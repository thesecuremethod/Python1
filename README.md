Here you can find a handful of small python and bash scripts that I have written. 

The Weather Script  -- this was a fun one,  written in 2013 when a friend asked my to use python to pull down a list of cities from a 
                    certain county, list them in ascending order by name and corresponding current temperature. Bound and Determined to 
                    pull and reorder weather data from *.gov APIs. 

The CNN Script  -- Lets get this one in here. This was my first example of learning how to work with text files from the command prompt
                   The exercise was to read from the source code of CNN's home page and count the number of lines on which the string           
                   "text/javascript" appeared, and do it with one bash command.
